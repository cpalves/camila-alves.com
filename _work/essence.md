<h1>Essence</h1>


<p>ESSENCE Fashion Communication offers services in image consulting assisting in the development of adversting campaigns, propagation material and composition of visual identity elements for fashion companies and institutions.</p>

<p>The ESSENCE highlight is the artistic touch the company offers with its work, using different communication languages such as manual and digital illustrations, collages and image manipulation. The company embodies the clients identity to comprehend its universe, its theme and the public it desires to achieve, to translate with excellente, through images, the client's essence.To find inspiration for my illustrations, I dove into my favourite conceptual designers, such as Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, but also young designers that are bold enough to venture into the fashion industry with conceptual, artistic, fresh creations.</p>
