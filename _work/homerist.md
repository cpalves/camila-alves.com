<h1>Homerist</h1>


<p>Homerist is an accessible, hassle-free online interior design company. It was created behind the idea that interior design should be reachable to all sorts of people. The company acts locally on big European cities like Berlin, Paris, Stockholm and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Homerist is different from other online interior design services in a way that it doesn’t take care of logistics, buying and delivery, but it guides people to where they need to go in their cities to find the right pieces (and the right price), within a portfolio of local furniture and art shops, and that is what makes it so affordable. Homerist doesn’t want anyone to think that interior designers are a luxury, because everyone deserves to live in a beautiful place that they can call home. I developed the brand's identity from designing the logo to developing their visual identity, colour palette and applications.</p>
