<h1>Eat My Plastics</h1>


<p>This is one of my final project from university. I created an advertising campaign inspired by the Brazilian footwear brand Melissa. They are a very innovative brand with an interesting concept of making shoes only from plastic.</p>

<p>I chose Pop Art as a theme for this campaign because of the connections I see between the art movement and the brand. They are both very colourful, literal and commercial. I went to Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for aesthetic inspiration. The language for this project is a mixture of photography, digital illustration and hand drawings.</p>
