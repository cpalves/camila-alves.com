<h1>Matter of shape</h1>


<p>This work was part of my final project from university, which I divided in three parts.  All three sections had the same subject, fashion image. For this one, the theme was:

<p>“Fashion as a support to shapes that transcend the body and the apparel. A transition from wearable to admirable.”</p>

<p>To find inspiration for my illustrations, I dove into my favourite conceptual designers, such as Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto, but also young designers that are bold enough to venture into the fashion industry with conceptual, artistic, fresh creations.</p>
